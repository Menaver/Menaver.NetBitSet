# NetBitSet â€“ Bit-level working provider for .NET

#### Tool set, providing processing of any type of data on bit level

###### Options
- Transformation of any type of data to a bit stream
- Converting of bit array to a structed data
- Implementation of access to each individual bit by indexer
- Combining different lengths of data (up to 256 MB)
- Representation of binary data as an 8/32-bit numerical value
- Getting the size in bytes occupied by a particular object in memory
- Converting data into binary string + reverse operation
- Internal support for all bit operations
- Bitwise comparison of various types of data, and more...

###### Features
- Compact storage of each bit
- Implementation of 3-standard interfaces: ICollection, IComparable and ICloneable
- The sealed partial-class, divided into a single project into separate modules, each of which is responsible for a specific set of tasks
- Abundance class constructor overloads, enabling you to create an instance of a wide range of data types
- Implicit and explicit operators that provide a more convenient connection and extraction of copies value
- Internal data representation as a combination of blocks of different lengths, and more...
